# Assignment2-Springboot-Library-rest-api

A Spring Boot RESTful Web API for managing a library system. This application allows CRUD operations for Books, Publishers, and Members with full MySQL database integration. Tested using Postman, it supports creating and retrieving library data like book details, member registration, and publisher information. Fantastic for learning enterprise Java development with Spring Boot, JPA, and RESTful architecture.
