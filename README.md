**Assignment2-SpringBoot-Library-Rest-API**
A Spring Boot RESTful Web API for managing a basic library system. This application currently supports Create and Read operations for Books, Publishers, and Members with full MySQL database integration. It has been tested using Postman to ensure smooth functionality for adding and retrieving data such as book records, publisher details, and member profiles.

Fantastic for learning enterprise Java development with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and RESTful architecture. Future enhancements can include Update and Delete operations to complete full CRUD functionality.
